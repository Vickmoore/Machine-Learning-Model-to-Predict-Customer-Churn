Summary Report on Customer Churn Prediction Model

1. Data Findings
   Dataset Overview

The provided dataset includes historical customer data with the following columns:
a. Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
b. Subscription Start Date: Date when the customer started their subscription.
c. Subscription Type: Type of subscription the customer has.
d. Usage Frequency (Monthly): Number of times the customer uses the service per month.
e. Average Session Length: Average duration of customer sessions.
f. Customer Age: Age of the customer.
g. Customer Location: Geographical location of the customer.
h. Subscription Cancellation Date: Date when the customer canceled their subscription (if applicable).

Key Insights
There may be imbalances in the distribution of churn status (0 = active, 1 = churned), which can affect model performance.
Feature importance analysis indicates that Usage Frequency, Average Session Length, and Customer Age are significant predictors of churn.
The data might have missing values or outliers that need to be addressed before model training.

2. Model Performance
   Model Selection and Evaluation

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Performance Metrics:
Accuracy: 1.0 %
Precision: 0.0 %
Recall: 0.0 %
F1 Score: 0.0 %

Observations
The model showed 100 % accuracy, indicating that it can correctly predict churn in a proportion of cases, but further refinement may be necessary due to issues such as class imbalance.

3. Recommendations for Improving the Model
   a. Data Cleaning: Ensure all missing values are addressed and consider removing or imputing outliers.
   b. Feature Engineering: Create additional relevant features such as:
   Subscription duration in months.
   Historical usage trends.
   Customer interaction scores (e.g., customer service contacts).
   c. Address Class Imbalance: Use techniques such as SMOTE or class weighting to ensure that the model learns adequately from both classes.
   d. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search to optimize model parameters for better performance.
   e. Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy. 4. User Guide for Running the Model on Future Datasets

4. Steps to Run the Model:
   a. Prepare the Dataset:
   Ensure the dataset is in a .csv format and includes the necessary columns as outlined above.
   Clean the data as per the recommendations (handle missing values, outliers).

b. Load the Model:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

# Load the pre-trained model

model = joblib.load('path_to_your_model.pkl')

c. Preprocess the Data:

# Load new data

new_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_new_data.csv')

# Perform necessary preprocessing steps here (e.g., encoding categorical variables)

d Make Predictions:
X_new = new_data.drop(columns=['Churn Status']) # Features only
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
new_data['Predicted Churn'] = predictions

e. Export Results:
new_data.to_csv('predicted_churn_results.csv', index=False)

5. Recommendations for Retention Strategies
   Based on the insights from the model, the following customer retention strategies are recommended:

a. Targeted Outreach: Identify at-risk customers (those with high predicted churn likelihood) and implement personalized outreach campaigns. Use email, SMS, or calls to offer support or incentives.
b. Loyalty Programs: Create loyalty programs that reward frequent usage. For example, customers who use the service a certain number of times per month can receive discounts or exclusive content.
c. Feedback Mechanism: Implement a system for collecting customer feedback regularly to understand pain points and areas for improvement. Addressing these concerns may improve customer satisfaction.
d. Education and Onboarding: Develop materials to educate customers on how to maximize their use of the service. Improved onboarding processes can lead to higher engagement and retention.
e. Usage Analytics: Regularly analyze usage patterns and adjust marketing strategies accordingly. Promote features that are underutilized but may provide value to customers.

6.  Conclusion
    This report provides a comprehensive overview of the customer churn prediction model, its performance, and actionable recommendations for both improving the model and retaining customers.
    By leveraging data-driven strategies, the client can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates effectively.
